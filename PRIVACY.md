# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines how **TalkTree Editor** handles user data and privacy. I am committed to protecting your personal information and ensuring transparency in the project's data practices.

## 2. Data Collection
**TalkTree Editor** does not collect, store, or share any personal data. The application requires permissions to access certain directories or system resources to function properly.

## 3. Permissions
The program has only the [authorization](https://github.com/c-smo/TalkTree-Edit/blob/main/TalkTree_Edit/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json) to access specific directories as defined in its configuration file.

## 4. Third-Party Services
If the application interacts with third-party services, their respective privacy policies apply. I ensure that only the minimal required amount of information is shared; however, I recommend reviewing their policies for further details.

## 5. Data Security
I take appropriate measures to ensure the security of any data processed by the application. However, users should always follow best security practices when handling sensitive data.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any significant changes will be communicated through the project [repository](https://github.com/c-smo/TalkTree-Edit).

## 7. Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact me at **c-smolic@proton.me**.
